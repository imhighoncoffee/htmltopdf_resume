        <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
        <p>First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving
            the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon
            and returning him safely to the earth. No single space project in
            this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important
            for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so
            difficult or expensive to accomplish.</p>

        <p>Dear Company,</p>
        <p>Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it
           everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of,
           every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.
           The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident
           religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and
           forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of
           civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love,
           every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer,
           every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,
           every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and
           sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote
           of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>

        <p>The view of the Earth from the Moon fascinated me-a small disk,
           240,000 miles away. It was hard to think that that little thing
           held so many problems, so many frustrations.
           Raging nationalistic interests, famines, wars,
           pestilence don't show from that distance.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>First M. Last</p>
